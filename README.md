# OpenGL

Using the OpenGL standard to draw simple objects to the screen. I'm using this repository to store the code I write while learning to use OpenGL. Eventually, I would like to use it to make simple simulations of various real world phenomena such as a solar system simulation.
Below is some of the output of the simple shaders written:
